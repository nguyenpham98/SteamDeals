# SteamDeals
Built an Android mobile app that allows single sign-on with Google accounts, bookmark favorite game deals from Steam store.

Features:
- Single sign-on with Google accounts: I followed Firebase documentation on setting up with Flutter using this link: 
https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/flutter/federated-auth
- Bookmark deals: set up collection of users on Firebase so every user has their own wishlist array where the game deals are placed when bookmarked
- Dynamic search bar: deals are fetched dynamically from CheapShark API using title entered by users on search bar so results are different on changes.

Technology: 
- Flutter, Firebase, CheapShark API, Dart
